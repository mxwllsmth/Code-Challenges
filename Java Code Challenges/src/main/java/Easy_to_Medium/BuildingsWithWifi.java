    Buildings with Wifi - Takes in three lists and finds if all buildings are served -
    A building is considered served when the number of routers supporting the building is equal to or greater than the head count of the building
        'buildingCount' is a head count per building (indexes represent buildings) -
        'routerLocation' is the building number where a router is located (buildings numbered ascending from 1)
        'routerRange' is connected by index to routerLocation and represents the range of the router (location + & - range ---- inclusive)
    Return the number of served buildings

    I completed this challenge during an interview and had 10/14 test cases passing with this solution
    Test cases that I've thought of and pass can be found in the corresponding test folder

    If you can figure out what test cases I missed, I would love to hear from you with the case and the solution if you've cracked it :)
